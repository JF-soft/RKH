 * 	Portable data types.

 * 	The RKH uses a set of integer quantities. That maybe 
 * 	machine or compiler	dependent.
 *
 * 	Note:
 *
 * 	The 'HUInt' and 'HInt' will normally be the natural size 
 * 	for a particular machine. These types designates an integer 
 * 	type that is usually fastest to operate with among all integer 
 * 	types.
