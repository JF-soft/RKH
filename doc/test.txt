\n The goal in this section is to explain how to test a state machine 
using the RKH framework and its recommended test fixture. To do that is 
proposed a lot of complete state machines, which are shown in the 
\ref fig_smTest "Used state machine for transtion unit tests" and 
\ref fig_smPseudoTest "Used state machine for pseudostate unit tests" figures. 

Also, this section summarizes the main rules and concepts for making the most 
out of RKH features. For more information see section \ref test_sm "Module, unit tests and tools for TDD"
