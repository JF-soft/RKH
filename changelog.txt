		task control block of previously created task.
	+	Added execution time measurement facility within rkutils.h file by
		means rkstart_time_measure(), rkend_time_measure() and 
		rkget_time_measure() functions. This facility must be enable or
		disable by means RKSYS_TIME_MEASURE macro in rksyscfg.h file.
	+	Changed macro definitions RKSYS_NUM_PRIORITY_LEVEL and RKSYS_NUM_TASKS 
		by RKSYS_TASK_NUM_PTY_LEVEL and RKSYS_TASK_NUM_TASKS respectively.
	+	Changed definition of task number and priority level number from 
		rksyscfg.h. Now, RKSYS_TASK_NUM_PTY_LEVEL and RKSYS_TASK_NUM_TASKS
		must be defined as macro in rksyscfg.h file.
	+	Deleted definition of RKSYS_MUTEX_TASK_PER_MUTEX from rksyscfg.h. Now,
		it's directly defined by RKSYS.
	+	Added and changed several verification of constraints in rksys.h file.
	+	Added new conditional compilations in schdr.c/.h file.
	+	Sometimes codewarrior IDE launchs the linker error L1907. Then, 
		must be added the comiler option -OnB=b.

		Therefore, the interfaces of ffile_queue_open_as_random() and
		ffile_queue_random_read() functions has been changed according to new
		features.
	+	Changed TRACE_EVENT_T structure for supporting access to its members.
	+	Changed kernel version format on RKSYS_VERSION macro.
	+	Fixed pointer to file structure within ffile_file_format() function.

		expansion.
	+	Changed various error strings within rksys.h file.
	+	Added RKSYS_TIMER_SCOUNTER on rksyscfg.h file for setting the size of
		timer counter.

Changes between V2.51 and V2.52 released August 31th 2009
